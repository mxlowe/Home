				<h3>About</h3> 
    		Matthew X. Lowe is currently a postdoctoral associate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab (CSAIL) (PI: Aude Oliva; Computational Perception and Cognition Lab). Matthew obtained his PhD from the University of Toronto (PIs: Jonathan S. Cant; Susanne Ferber), and his bachelor's degree from the University of Cape Town. 
		<p>Broadly, his work investigates perception, with a goal to understand how we process the world around us. The majority of his work investigates the spatial and temporal dynamics underlying the processing of visual and auditory input using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), magneto- and electroencephalography (MEG/EEG), computational neuroscience techniques, and behavioural investigations. He is also interested in the role of individual differences in shaping our unique experience of the world.

<p>Currently, his work at MIT involves the investigation of the spatiotemporal neural dynamics underlying auditory processing of various sound sources using MEG, fMRI, and MEG-fMRI similarity-based fusion. The goal of his current research is to elucidate the spatial and temporal neural constraints which govern auditory perception. By building on his work in both vision and audition, his future goals aim to explore the processing of audiovisual signals in the human brain. </p>
		
<p>Outside of his work, Matthew seeks adventure in the outdoors. He has trekked through the Arctic Circle and climbed to the peak of the highest mountains in South America (Mt. Aconcagua), Europe (Mt. Elbrus), Africa (Mt. Kilimanjaro), and his home country, South Africa (Mafadi).</p>
